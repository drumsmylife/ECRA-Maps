# ECRA-Maps

# Importing a CSV-File into the Google Maps API
INFO
1. This project was created to show how to import a csv file into the google maps API.
2. It uses information from a csv and displays that information on the map
3. Uses map markers to show where those specific locations are in the U.S.


# Directions
1. Clone the repo and open the project.

2. Run npm install to install dependencies.

3. Run npm run dev to run the project using webpack-dev-server.

4. Click get started and choose your CSV File or JSON file

5. DO NOT USE A BIG CSV FILE WITH A TON OF ROWS/COLUMNS. IT WILL TAKE TOO LONG TO LOAD. CHOOSE A SMALLER CSV FILE WITH A SHORT AMOUNT OF INFO. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE GOOGLE API USAGE LIMIT. If it is loading very slow then the file is too big. 
 
6. Match all required fields with each other
 - address to address
 - city to city
 - state to state
 - zip to zip
 
7. You can check the optional fields if you want but do not have to
